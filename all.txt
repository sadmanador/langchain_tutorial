on 22 August 2024Please Note
The information contained in this book is intended to complement, not substi -
tute for, the advice of your child’s pediatrician. Before starting any medical 
treatment or medical program, you should consult with your child’s pediatri -
cian, who can discuss your child’s individual needs and counsel you about symptoms and treatment. If you have questions regarding how the information in this book applies to your child, speak to your child’s pediatrician.
Products mentioned in this book are for informational purposes only. In -
clusion in this publication does not constitute or imply a guarantee or an en -
dorsement by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
The information and advice in this book apply equally to children of both 
sexes (except where noted). To indicate this, we have chosen to alternate be -
tween masculine and feminine pronouns throughout the book. Best efforts were made to use people first language, and as such, certain phrasing may not read as familiar. For example, “an overweight child” now reads as “a child with overweight” or “a child has overweight.”
